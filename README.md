3. PURPOSE OF THIS DASHBOARD :
   The purpose of the dashboard is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the pizza business's sales data to help stakeholders make informed, data-driven decisions. It serves to:
                        
                        --> Track Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): 
                            It provides a quick and clear overview of the business's financial health and performance through metrics like total revenue, total pizzas sold, and average order value.
                            
                        --> Identify Trends: 
                            The dashboard visualizes sales trends over different time periods, such as daily, weekly, and monthly, which helps in optimizing operations like staffing, 
                             inventory management, and marketing campaigns.
                             
                        --> Optimize the Menu: 
                            By identifying the best and worst-selling pizzas, it allows the business to focus on popular items, potentially introduce new variations of successful pizzas,
                            and consider removing or revamping underperforming ones.
                            
                        --> Understand Customer Behavior:
                           It breaks down sales by category and size to reveal customer preferences, which can guide future menu development and promotional strategies.
